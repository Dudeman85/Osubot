# Osubot
A bot that plays osu!
(Log out of osu! or you will get banned)

#### Only works on:
- Osu!mania
- 1080p output
- Windows 10
- Custom texturepack
- Default keybinds

## How to
***You need .net core 3.1***
Add "Bot" folder to osu skins.
Run exe(not virus I promise) located in "publish folder"
Choose the amount of keys in the song. (To change amount restart the script)
Ctr + c to quit

(I made this for fun for my computer specifically so probably wont even work on another one)
